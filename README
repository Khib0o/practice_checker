Things to do to be able to run the program:

-Install Python (Programming language) https://www.python.org/

-Open a command invite in the folder where run.bat, scrapper.py and requirements.txt are present (replace the path in the path bar
by cmd and type enter)

-Run the command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

You should be ready to then start the program
Those steps should only be executed once

OR

-Go into the command line interface again and type:
python scrapper.py
